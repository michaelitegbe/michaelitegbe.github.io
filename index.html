                        As a skilled cloud security engineer, I possess a deep understanding of both cloud-specific security and broader cybersecurity principles. This allows me to craft secure cloud-native applications and fortify cloud-based infrastructures (AWS & Azure) against ever-evolving security threats. My expertise lies in Identity and Access Management (IAM), where I leverage cutting-edge solutions like AWS Cognito and Azure RBAC to meticulously control access and minimize potential attack vectors.

However, my skillset extends beyond the realm of IAM. I excel in building resilient cybersecurity programs that not only secure cloud environments, but also encompass the entire IT landscape. This includes proactively identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in networks, systems, and applications.  I stay abreast of the latest cyber threats, implementing robust security measures to prevent breaches and ensure organizational resilience.

Furthermore, my passion lies in empowering organizations to not just survive in the digital age, but to thrive. By securing their most precious asset – data – I enable them to create enduring value and build trust with their stakeholder
